## Recursion
### Recursion is when a function calls itself until someone stops it. If no one stops it then it'llrecurse (call itself) forever. Recursive functions let you perform a unit of work multiple times.Modern programming languages like JavaScript already have the for and while statements as alternatives to recursive functions. But some languages like Closure do not have any looping statements, so you need to use recursion to repeatedly execute a piece ofcode.

## Note 
### A recursion function keep calling it self untill we stope it and we can do it by adding F conditions and others conditions that have a start tag and end and another tag EX. IF ELSE


## closure
### A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function
